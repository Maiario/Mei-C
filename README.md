<h1> Who gave you the link to my shit?  </h1>
  
  <p> I'll just put some random content here, since I'm still new when it comes to programming, so this is my experimentation page. </p>

<p> <strong> I've learned the basics of HTML in Khan Academy, they have helped me a lot when it comes to inhancing my knowledge in programming,and at first I was really confused on how I could create a webpage using github, so I've watched a couple of videos in youtube, and then, walaa! I've finally made one. </strong> </p>

<p> I wanted to put a video here, but ema just look up some toturial first. </p>

<p> since this is experimentation website, I decided to put my youtube video content in here and my other social media accounts , since I don't know what to write. </p>

<p> <strong> anyways I got tag on this post by my cousins in facebook, it's a book pdf with a google drive link, ema just drop the link here so I won't lose it, and you can view this link if you're interested with reading books </strong> </p>

<p> and also, I was wondering about "style" on html, like can I used it here also? but I already put a theme on my website? I just want to use the font, like monospace, but nothing will happens if I won't try, so let's see. </p> 


<h2> I'll change the font of this one, it's "h2" </h2>

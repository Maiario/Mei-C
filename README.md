<p> <strong> I've learned the basics of HTML in Khan Academy, they have helped me a lot when it comes to inhancing my knowledge in programming,and at first I was really confused on how I could create a webpage using github, so I've watched a couple of videos in youtube, and then, eyyy! I've finally made one. </strong> </p>

<p> I wanted to put a video here, but ema just look up some tutorial first. </p>

<p> since this is a experimentation website, I decided to put my youtube video content in here and my other social media accounts , since I don't know what to write. </p>

<p> and also, I was wondering about "style" on html, like can I used it here also? but I already put a theme on my website? I just want to use the font, like monospace, but nothing will happens if I won't try, so let's see. </p> 


<h2> I'll change the font of this one, it's "h2" <--- </h2>

<p> It did worked! hahaha I couldn't see the changes in my "preview" so I thought that It didn't worked, yey! I'll change the font and size of all the words in here to monospace! :) </p>

<p> aight! the changes have been completed! I've change the font style into monospace and make a bit italic, the font size is still the same, andddd anyways, </p>

<a href="https://www.wattpad.com/user/Maiario"> follow me also on my wattpad account, I've been writing stories in here since I got bored with my quarantine life cycle, so I hope that you'll check it! </a>

<p> Brooooooooo, I checked this out in my website, and aaaaaaa I like how they also included the prologue of the story, that's so fucking cool bro! </p> 

<p> anyways, this is BL story, and it's 18+ only, It has a lot of grammatical errors but fuck it, I'm still new when it comes to writing and my english words or tpying is not that really perfect, but trust me, I'm trying to enchance it. T_T </p> 

<p>  <strong> I didn't like the development of the story, Chapter 5 above is the worst shit I have ever written, I didn't like the fact that I didn't make the protagonist into an intellectual person, I mean they didn't really make any stupid decisions or maybe they did, I just wished that I made the scene much more cooler, and also the two poor bois shouldn't have been kidnapped ( at this point, I don't know if my grammar is still okay but whatever, no one's gonna see this shit anyway) but the damage have been done, and I can't or maybe, I can actually do some edits but I'm too lazy to do it, so the story is on paused for now, cause I'm still sulking </strong> </p>

<h3> and that's the reason why I created this storyyyy! this is my first college romance story, and I'm loving it! this is just my forte atm, I got influenced by the romance manhwa's, so I created this shit ;) </h3>

<p> but anyways, I hope that you don't mind me cursing, it's my usual habit, and it has been a part of me, and it helps me a lot when it comes to relieving stress, and I believe that no one is innocent in this world, and just because someone love's to curse doesn't mean that they are a rotten person, so fuck it! :) </p>

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li> 2 whole free-range, organic chickens </li>
            <li> Vegetable oil of choice, for frying the chicken </li>
            
            <li> 6 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> 5 tablespoons salt </li>
<li> 4 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons garlic powder </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon onion powder </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper </li>
            <li> 2 cups buttermilk </li>
 
            


        
            
            
            
        </ul>
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Cooking</th>
                    <th> Steps</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside.
</p>
        
    <p> <strong> Step 2: </strong> Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 3: </strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 4: </strong> Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 5: </strong> Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that, your bowl of buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 6: </strong> Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 7: </strong> Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust and crunch you are looking for. Gently place the breasts in your hot oil. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 8: </strong> Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg then wing. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 9:</strong> When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes. </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 10: </strong> After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast. If it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has been removed from the fryer.) </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Step 11: </strong>Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before serving. </p>

<p> <strong> Ingredients </strong> </p>
        
         <ul>
              <li> 4 cups cooked white rice </li>
              <li> ¼ cup cooking oil </li>

        <ul>
            <li> 1 lb. ground pork </li>
            <li> 1 lb. ground beef </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon onion powder </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>

  <p> <strong> Mushroom gravy  </strong> </p>
              
              <ul>
                  
                  <li> 1 4 oz. can sliced button mushrooms </li>
                  <li> 4 tablespoons butter </li>
                  <li> ¼ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
                  <li> 1 beef bouillon cube </li>
                  <li> 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
                  <li> 1 ½ cups water </li>
                  
                  <p> <strong> Instructions </strong> </p>

  <ol> 
      
      <li> Prepare the patty by combining all the burger patty ingredients in a bowl. Mix well. </li>
      <li> Scoop around ½ cup of burger patty mixture and roll it into a sphere. Gently press the patty to form a disk shaped figure. Set aside and then perform the same step until the mixture is consumed. </li>
      <li> Meanwhile, prepare the mushroom gravy by melting the butter in a cooking pot. Once the butter starts to get hot, add the sliced mushrooms. Cook for 20 seconds and then put-in the beef bouillon and garlic powder. Gently press against the bouillon until it breaks down into pieces or it simply gets squashed. Stir and cook until all ingredients are well blended. Push the mushrooms on one side of the pot and tilt the pot to let the butter slow to the opposite side. Add the flour on the side with butter. Stir until the flour absorbs the butte. Continue to cook while stirring until the flour turns light brown. You may stir the mushrooms in with the flour while you are browning it. Pour water and continue to stir until the flour mixture dilutes completely. Continue to cook in low to medium heat until the desired thickness is achieved. Transfer to a bowl. Set aside. Note: you can add more water if needed. Some scenarios would be: if mixture is so thick, or if the taste is too strong. </li>
      <li>Start to cook the patties by pouring oil in a wide frying pan. Pan-fry each side in medium heat for 4 minutes. </li>
      <li> Arrange a cup of rice in a plate. Top with two to three pieces of burger patties and finish with mushroom gravy on top. </li>

<h1> Welcome to my page! </h1>
  
  <p> I'll just put some random content here, since I'm still new when it comes to programming, so this is my experimentation page. </p>

<p> I've learned the basics of HTML in Khan Academy, they help me a lot when it comes to inhancing my knowledge in programming, at first I was really confused on how I could create a webpage using github, so I've watched a couple of videos in youtube, and then, walaa! I've finally made one </p>

<p> I wanted to put a video here, but ema just look up some toturial first </p>

<p> since this is experimentation website, I decided to put my youtube video content in here and my other social media accounts , since I don't know what to write </p>
